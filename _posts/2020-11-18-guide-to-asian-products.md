asian cusine is very flavourful and diverse and for that reason it can be very interesting to incorporate some of the ingredients in our meals, which can help to make our diet vary and different everyday. it can be very confusing to understand what the products are and where to find the cheapest option in the market, which is what we are going to help you with in this guide.
all of the products that we will mention can be found in supermarkets but they tend to be more expensive and the choice is very limited. the most convenient way to find them is in an asian shop (in bigger cities there’s always a china town), where they are found in cheap and also bigger packages. sometimes also the international grocers have them…there’s no rule, just take a couple hours to go scouting for the perfect asian-goodies provider!


## noodles
with a shape similar to spaghetti, noodles were born in china more than 4 thousand years ago.
they are usually prepared with water and flour. unlike pasta noodles, they are most likely  made of rice flour, buckwheat, mungo bean, corn or seaweed. thicker noodles are usually cooked like pasta in boiling water, thinner ones are usually rehydrated in hot water before going into the pan with the condiment. they can then be served dry, hot, cold or even in tasty soups.
there are various types of noodles, but to make it easier for you and for us, we will first tell you about the two main types of noodles that can be switched up among all the recipes, and then go in deeper with the other kinds. these two are 
1.	*rice “linguini”*: best used in stir fries like pad thai.

2.	*rice vermicelli*: great in soups and need a very short resting time in hot water.

being made of rice they are easier to cook and less chewy than the soy ones.

now, if you really want to be a professional cook (:), here’s more about noodles: 
1.	*rice noodles*: typical of china and southeast asia. made from rice starch, rice noodles are available in all kinds of lengths and widths, and can be found in the cuisines of nearly every asian and southeast asian country. while fresh rice noodles are available in the bigger asian groceries, the number of varieties of dried rice noodles far outnumber the fresh kind. Rice noodles are featured in soups and stir-fries, and dried rice noodles will often need to be soaked or parboiled before cooking. most rice noodles are flat and while there is great variation in noodle width—with some of the wider ones being around a centimeter wide—most measure around 1/4-inch, or about the same width as linguini. 
2.	*soy spaghetti* (or vermicelli): they’re korean and also called glass noodles (see pic) or mungo bean noodles. more consistent and elastic than rice noodles, they should be hydrated with boiling water before using them in soups, spring rolls or jumping in the wok.

3.	*udon*: Japanese noodles made of wheat that exist fresh or dried. to make them even better they should be soaked before using them in recipes.

4.	*instant ramen noodles*: finally, are those of american tv shows. they are instant and there are both precooked and flavored. they are often sold in plastic packages that also contain a soup preparation, just add some hot water first and let it rest for a few minutes to taste them.

5.	*shirataki noodles*: a special type of noodles: shirataki are a type of spaghetti made from the root of konjac, a native plant of the asian subtropical temperate zone.
they have a low carbohydrate content and are therefore particularly recommended in all diets based on a limited carbohydrate intake as well as those for diabetics. they are also poor in other macronutrients and this results in a very low specific calorie intake compared to italian pasta, which is why we don’t use them much. 
fun fact: the term "shirataki", describes the appearance of the noodles, it means "white waterfall".

## miso paste
when cooking asian dishes, especially soups, this ingredient can’t miss. it’s a paste made of fermented soy beans and it serves just like vegetable stock, asian-style. the soybeans are mixed with salt and koji, a mold that’s also used to make sake. the blend might also include barley, rice, rye or other grains. to get its unique flavor, the mixture ferments for anywhere from a couple months to years! the longer it ages, the miso paste gets darker and more complex in flavor. 
not only does miso add a savory element to your dish, it’s also good for you. because it’s a fermented seasoning, miso paste contains probiotics, healthy bacteria which may boost your immunity, promote a healthier gut and help alleviate some of the symptoms of depression and anxiety.

## soy sauce
soy sauce is a brown, salty liquid condiment made by fermenting soybeans or breaking them down with acid (hydrolyzing). soy sauce provides salt, sweet, umami (savory), and even a little bitter flavor. this balanced flavor profile makes it an excellent condiment. 
soy sauce can be added when cooking stews or soups. It's a basic way of building depth of flavor, is not affected by heat during cooking, and can provide a pleasing brown color to your dish. In stir-fries, it is usually mixed with the vegetables before including the noodles, but more soy sauce can be added at any time in the cooking process.

there are hundreds of varieties of soy sauce that are available on the market today. these varieties depend on the ingredients used, the method used to create the sauce, and the region in which it is made.
1.	*light soy sauce* is the thin, brown liquid that we mostly refer to as regular soy sauce. It is a good all-purpose seasoning and condiment and traditionally what is used when eating sushi.

2.	*dark soy sauce* has had molasses or caramel added after the brewing process, which thickens the sauce slightly and produces a sweeter, more complex flavor. it’s very strong flavoured and kind of hard to measure, which is why we never use it (nor suggest it :)

3.	for people watching their salt intake, a *low-sodium soy sauce* may be the sauce of choice. salt is an important component in the production of soy sauce because it acts as an antimicrobial agent.

NB. tamari is a japanese soy sauce that is made with only soybeans and no wheat or other grains. tamari has a very clean flavor and is favored by those who follow a wheat- or gluten-free diet.

## coconut milk  
coconut products have burst into popularity over the last few years, including coconut milk, coconut oil, etc., but let's try to better understand the differences between all the products:
1. *coconut milk*: it has long been a key ingredient in southeast asian cooking, and it’s made from the pulp of a mature coconut by grating the pulp, soaking it in water, and pressing the liquid. 
coconut milk adds richness to sauces, braised dishes, curries (yumyumyum!) and noodle soups. there are various types that differ by fat content. regular coconut milk (which is the one we normally use) has a consistency closer to dairy cream.  when it separates, it will look like gray water with a thick white layer at the top (this is the coconut “cream”, but when we cook, we shake it and use it all combined). avoid “low-fat” or “light” coconut milk, which is simply a watered down version. it’s usually the same price as the regular stuff, but you’re getting more water than coconut! if you’d like to reduce the fat in your recipes, simply add less, and replace some of it with water yourself.
thick coconut milk on the other hand, often labeled coconut cream (don’t confuse it with “cream of coconut,” which has added sugar), has the highest amount of fat and a thick consistency similar to yogurt.
coconut milk is usually availabe in cans. if we just need a little bit in a recipe you can store it in an air-tight container but make sure to eat it in the following days (because of its high fat content, it can go rancid quickly. if you do have some left over and don’t want to use it right away, you can put it in the freezer for longer term storage).

1. *coconut water*: it's the liquid that comes from non-mature coconuts. because it doesn’t include the coconut flesh, coconut water is much lower in fat and calories, and more suitable for drinking than for cooking. 
2. *coconut drink*: it has a texture which is in-between coconut milk and water, it's very sweet and it's usually drunk just like the other nut milks (almond, soy, etc.)


## shriracha sauce
sriracha is a hot and tangy sauce originating from thailand that is typically eaten with seafood or used as a dipping sauce. made from a paste of chillis, garlic, vinegar, sugar and salt, sriracha gives savoury dishes a kick. nowadays people also drizzle some of it on avocado toasts and so on, because it is very flavourful and hot.
