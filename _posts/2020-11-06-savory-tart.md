this savory tart is very tasty and nutritious, thanks to the use of green leaf vegetables and to the proteins provided by the tofu. 
you can modify the filling as you wish: change the spinach with zucchini or other green leaf veggies (such as beets or turnip tops), add more tofu (up to 500g!) or change it with pulses (we tried with fava beans and loved it), change the dired tomatoes with capers or simply add them if you wish! 
the recipe we provide here is just a starting point for your creativity.

*the whole tart makes 4 full portions*

# for the tart dough

## ingredients
---

- flour of choice (we used semi-whole spelt, but you can use all-purpose too): 400g
- seed oil (peanut or sunflower): 90g
- extra-virgin olive oil: 90g
- water: 200g
- salt
- sugar: 1 teaspoon
  
## procedure
---

add the dry ingredients to the liquid ingredients and knead for a few minutes until smooth. you will have a greasy, very soft and elastic dough at the end. it is not necessary to let it rest before rolling out.

# for the filling

## ingredients
---

- spinach (or other leafy vegetable of choice): 500g
- tofu: 350g
- dried tomatoes: 7
- garlic: 1 clove
- salt and chili pepper

## procedure
---

1. mince tha garlic and sauté in extra-virgin olive oil with the chili pepper.
2. add the spinach with a pinch of salt and cook at medium heat, stirring.
3. in the meantime, crumble the tofu with your hands.
4. chop the dried tomatoes in small pieces.
5. when the spinach is cooked (10 minutes) add the tofu and the chopped dried tomatoes.
6. optional: you can mix everything in a blender to have a more compact filling. 
7. take 2/3 of the previously made dough and roll it out in a baking pan covered with parchment paper. put the dough directly in the pan and press it with you fingers until you have covered the bottom of the pan. press it on the sides too.
8. put the filling inside.
9. roll out the remaing 1/3 of dough on parchment paper. it should be very elastic and easy to roll out with your hands.
10. cover the tart with it and pinch it all around the sides. put the parchment paper aside.
11. pierce the surface with a fork (it will let the steam go out so your tart will not be wet and will cook faster).
12. cook for half an hour in 180° C pre-heated ventilated oven.
13. remove from the oven when the dough is golden and crunchy.
