*quantities for 2 abundant portions*



## ingredients
---

- oil of choice
- onion: 1
- pupkin: 350g (around 1/4 of a pumpkin)
- carnaroli/arborio rice: 180g
- vegetable broth
- soy yogurt: 3 tablespoons
- salt
- cinnamon (optional)
- nutmeg (optional)
- sage to garnish (optional)

## procedure
---

1. first of all, warm up your vegetable broth or make it using boiling water and a veg stock cube.

2. chop the onion and sauté in a pan with a dash of oil.
   
3. chop your pumpkin in small pieces, (the smaller they are, the faster they'll cook) and add them to the pan with a couple of tablespoons of vegetable broth to help it not to stick. add the cinnamon, nutmeg and a pinch of salt. cover with the lid until soften.
   
4. now you're gonna blend the cooked pumpkin and onion to make a puré: you can either use a blender or a minipimer. once it's done, transfer the puré to a plate.

5. it's time for the rice! using the same pan, toast the rice with some oil for a minute or two. then add half of the puré, and cover it completely with vegetable broth.

6. now, you know the drill: keep adding vegetable broth (and keep stirring!!) until the rice is soft and puffy.

7. when the rice is ready, add the remaining puré along with the yogurt and mix it all, adding some broth if it doesn't look runny enough.

8. and there you have it! if you'd like, you can garnish with fresh sage or coriander!
