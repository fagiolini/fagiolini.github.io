crepes are a typical french dish that can be eaten savory or sweet. we propose here a neutral batter,slightly salty, perfect for both versions.

# for the crepes
*quantities for 14 middle-sized crepes*

## ingredients
---

- flour: 350g - we used half normal and half wholewhat
- corn or potato starch: 50g
- seeds oil: 2 tablespoons
- vegetable milk without added sugars: 450g
- water: 250g
- salt: 1 teaspoon

## procedure
---

1. mix the dry ingredients in a bowl: flour, starch and salt.
   
2. pour the liquid ingredients (milk, water, oil) little by little, while stirring to avoid lumps.

3. if you have the time, let the batter sit for 2 hours: this will help your crepes not to break when you fold them. otherwise, let it sit just for the time to prepare the filling.

4. warm a non-stick pan, greased with seeds oil. when it's well hot, pour one ladle of batter, and quickly move the pan to spread a thin layer of batter all over it. otherwise, use a spatula to spread it.

5. when the batter solidifies (about 1 minute), turn your crepe with the help of a spatula and cook it on the other side for one minute more.

5. repeat util you finish the batter. if after a while your crepes stick to the pan, grease it again.
