> [for filling ideas, see below](#filling-ideas)

> you can find noori seaweed and sticky rice in all big supermarkets, just look for the ethnic compartment. cheaper options are easily found in asian supermarmarkets. we always try to suggest alternatives in our recipies, but to obtain a nice sushi this time it is really important to use **sticky rice**. we tried with basmati rice to try to make it simpler, but it didn't work out.

> sticky rice is also called "glutinous rice", but as all rice it is glutenfree.

## procedure
---

1. cook the sticky rice through water absorption according to packaging instructions. we cooked the rice in an equivalent volume of water, covered, at low heat, until complete absorption - 15 minutes more or less, but this will depend on your rice.

2. while the rice cooks, mix the vinegar, the sugar and the salt.

3. put the cooked rice in a bowl, add the vinegar sauce and mix well.

4. let the rice cool down completely. in the meantime, star preparing your [fillings](#filling-ideas).

5. put one sheet of nori seaweed, rough side upward, on a sheet of aluminium foil.

6. put 1/3 of the rice on the seaweed, wet your hands with water and spread the rice all over the surface, pressing it well. leave around 2cm of free seaweed on the lower side.

7. put the filling in the center (see video below).

8. wet with water the seaweed on the lower side.

9. roll the sushi up, with the help of the aluminium foil, as shown in the video:

10. repeat for the remaining two sheets of noori seaweed.

11. wet the blade of a knife and cut your sushi rolls. if your knife is very sharp you should be able to cut it with a rapid and firm movement of the knife. if it is not too sharp, we suggest to cut the upper part of the seaweed with gentle back-and-forth movements, then procede to cut the rice and the filling with a rapid movement.

12. serve with soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, wasabi, ginger or any condiment of your taste!

> normally, to roll up sushi people use a sushi mat, but if, like us, you do not have it, we assure you that the alumunium foil will work just as well, as you can see in the video. just be sure to exert even pressure on your roll to close it well.
