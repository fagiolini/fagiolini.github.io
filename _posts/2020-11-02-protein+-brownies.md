suprising as it seems, these brownies are made with beans, but do not worry: you won't feel even the slightest taste of beans and gain an amazing texture for a dessert packed with proteins!

*quantities for 20 small brownies*

## ingredients
---

- cooked beans (any kind, this time we used cannellini white beans): 250g
- rolled oats or oat flour: 40g (if you are making it gluten free, make sure your oats are gf)
- sugar (or other sweetner): 60g
- cocoa powder: 10g
- sunflower oil: 40g
- baking powder: 2 teaspoons
- vanilla extract: 2 teaspoons
- dark chocolate: 100g

## procedure
---

1. if you are using rolled oats, blend them into a powder.
   
2. in a food processor (or a good blender) mix all the ingredients except for the chocolate (cooked beans - either canned and rinsed or previously cooked by yourself: find our suggestions [here](https://fagiolini.github.io/pulses-guide/) -, oat flour, sugar, cocoa, oil, baking powder and vanilla extract). mix very well: you should end up with a smooth and thick brown batter, with no recognizable bits of bean.
   
3. cut the dark chocolate in small pieces.
   
4. add them to the batter and mix with a spoon.
   
5. pour the batter in a mould, we used a round mould (diameter 22cm), but you can use a square mould of 20x20cm (or smaller if you like thicker brownies). spread it well in your mould with the help of a spoon.
   
6. bake it for 18 minutes at 180Â° C in static oven.
   
7. let it cool down, then cut it in squares and serve.
