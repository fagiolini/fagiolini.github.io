suprising as it seems, these brownies are made with beans ! do not worry, you won't feel even the slightest taste of beans, but will achieve an amazing texture for a dessert packed with proteins!

*quantities for 20 small brownies*

## ingredients
---

- beans of any kind: 250g boiled or 120g raw dried
- rolled oats or oat flour: 40g
- sugar or other sweetner: 60g
- cocoa powder: 10g
- sunflower oil: 40g
- baking powder: 2 teaspoons
- vanilla extract: 2 teaspoons
- dark chocolate: 100g

## procedure
---

0. if they are not canned, boil your beans - [find our suggestions here](https://fagiolini.github.io/pulses-guide/) 

1. if you are using rolled oats, blend them into a powder.
   
2. in a food processor or a good blender mix all the ingredients except for the chocolate: boiled beans, oat flour, sugar, cocoa, oil, baking powder and vanilla extract. mix very well: you should end up with a smooth and thick brown batter, with no recognizable bits of bean.
   
3. cut the dark chocolate in small pieces.
   
4. add them to the batter and mix with a spoon.
   
5. pour the batter in a mould, we used a round mould (diameter 22cm), but you can use a square mould of 20x20cm (or smaller if you like thicker brownies). spread it well in your mould with the help of a spoon.
   
6. bake it for 18 minutes at 180Â° C in static oven.
   
7. let it cool down, then cut it in squares and serve.
