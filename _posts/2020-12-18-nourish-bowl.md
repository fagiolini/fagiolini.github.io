nourish bowls, also know ad buddha bowls, are an awesome way to combine in one meal different textures and cooking methods. it's also a delicious way to use up leftovers! they're called "nourish bowls" because they contain each macronutrient and it's very easy to adjust and exchange them. 

here is a scheme to compose your bowl, with some ideas for grains, proteins, veggies and toppings, but feel free to change it up!

 > we're not gonna give you the quantities of each ingredient because you should feel free to eat as much as you feel like eating. however, to help yourself, we would suggest the plate method, the easiest way to make sure you're eating a balanced meal. 
 imagine your plate divided in 4 sections: 1/4 should be grains, 1/4 should be proteins and 2/4 should be veggies (or fruit).


*quantities for 2 abundant portions*



## grains
---

- quinoa
- brown/white rice
- millet
- barley
- pilaf rice: to see how to make it click [here](https://fagiolini.github.io/pilaf-rice/)


## proteins
---

- **marinated tofu/tempeh**: cut the tofu/tempeh in slices or cubes and let it sit (best done overnight but a few hours will do if you don't have the time) in the condiment you prefer: it could be lemon     juice and parley, soy sauce, orange juice and olive oil. then add it straight to your bowl or stir fry it to make it crunchier
  
- **beans**: red, kidney, cannellini...choose your fighter!
  
- **hummus**
  
- **spicy lentils**: sauté some cooked lentils with some olive oil, curry and chili pepper
  
- **sweet 'n sour chickpeas or tofu**: to see how to make them check [here](https://fagiolini.github.io/sweet-sour-chickpeas/)


## veggies
---

we like to use both cooked and fresh veggies, depending on the season. here are some ideas for this time of the year:

- fresh **rocket**
  
- **marinated carrots**: cut them julienne style and let them sit in orange juice, salt and a drizzle of olive oil
  
- **baked savoy cabbage**: finely chopped and topped with olive oil and bread crumbs before going in the oven
  
- **sauté green veggies**: sauté some turnip greens, some catalogna or some beets with olive oil, finely chopped garlic and chili pepper...hella delicious!
  
- **baked pumpkin** with cinnamon powder
  
- **steamed cauliflower or broccoli**
  
- **baked brussel sprouts**


## toppings
---

- finely sliced **avocado** (for some extra good fats)
  
- **seeds** of choice (sesame, pumpkin, hemp,...)
  
- **crunchy chickpeas**: mix some cooked with some olive oil and spices of choice (curry is amazing for this) and throw them in the oven until crunchy
  
- **sweet 'n sour sauce**: to make this, mix equal parts of soy sauce, lemon juice and sweetner of choice (can be sugar but also agave syrup or honey if you'd like)
  
- **yogurt sauce**: mix some soy yogurt with lemon juice, finely sliced chive, olive oil and salt and boom you have a great vegan creamy sauce!
  
- **marinated crumbled tofu**: crumble some tofu and let it sit in a bowl with some olive oil, lemon, sesame seeds, minced chive/onion and parsley
