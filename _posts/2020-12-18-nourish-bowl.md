nourish bowls, also know ad buddha bowls, are an awesome way to combine in one meal different textures and cooking methods. it's also a delicious way to use up leftovers! they're called "nourish bowls" because they contain each macronutrient and it's very easy to adjust and exchange them. 

here is a scheme to compose your bowl, with some ideas for grains, proteins, veggies and toppings, but feel free to change it up!

 > we're not gonna give you the quantities of each ingredient because you should feel free to eat as much as you feel like eating. however, to help yourself, we would suggest the plate method, the easiest way to make sure you're eating a balanced meal. 
 imagine your plate divided in 4 sections: 1/4 should be grains, 1/4 should be proteins and 2/4 should be veggies (or fruit).


*quantities for 2 abundant portions*



## grains
---
you'll need around 200g of one of these grains
- quinoa
- brown/white rice
- millet
- barley

## proteins
---


- **marinated tofu/tempeh**: cut 150g of tofu/tempeh in slices or cubes and let it sit (best done overnight but a few hours will do if you don't have the time) in the condiment you prefer: it could be lemon juice and parsley, soy sauce, orange juice and olive oil. then add it straight to your bowl or stir fry it to make it crunchier

- **beans**: 400g of canned red, kidney, cannellini beans...choose your fighter!
  
- **hummus**
  
- **spicy lentils**: sauté 400g of canned lentils with some olive oil, curry and chili pepper in a pan
  
- **sweet 'n sour chickpeas or tofu**: to see how to make them check [here](https://fagiolini.github.io/sweet-sour-chickpeas/)


## veggies
---

we like to use both cooked and fresh veggies, depending on the season. here are some ideas for this time of the year:

- fresh **rocket**: one fist

- **marinated carrots**: cut two carrots julienne style and let them sit in orange juice, salt and a drizzle of olive oil
  
- **baked savoy cabbage**: finely chop half of a head and top it with olive oil and a pinch of salt before cooking it in the oven for around 20 minutes at 180°C
  
- **sauté green veggies**: sauté some turnip greens, some catalogna or some beets (about 1/2 of a head) in a pan with two finely chopped garlic cloves, a drizzle of olive oil,a pinch of salt and some chili peppers...hella delicious!
  
- **baked pumpkin**: chop 1/4 of a pumpkin, mix it with some cinnamon powder, olive oil and some salt and cook it in the oven around 20 minutes at 180°C
  
- **steamed cauliflower or broccoli**: half of a head
  
- **baked brussel sprouts**: chop in half 150g of brussel sprouts, top them with olive oil, salt and herbs of your choice (rosemary tastes super yummy on them) and throw them in the oven for around 20 minutes at 180°C

 
## toppings
---

- finely sliced **avocado** (for some extra good fats): half of one will do just fine
  
- **seeds** of choice (sesame, pumpkin, hemp,...)
  
- **crunchy chickpeas**: mix 400g of canned chickpeas with some olive oil and spices of choice (curry is amazing for this) and throw them in the oven for around 10 minutes at 180°C until crunchy
  
- **sweet 'n sour sauce**: to make this, mix equal parts of soy sauce, lemon juice and sweetner of choice (can be sugar but also agave syrup or honey if you'd like)
  
- **yogurt sauce**: mix six tablespoons of soy yogurt with lemon juice, finely sliced chive, olive oil and salt and boom you have a great vegan creamy sauce!
  
- **marinated crumbled tofu**: crumble 150g of tofu and let it sit in a bowl with some olive oil, lemon, sesame seeds, minced chive/onion and parsley

now it's time to combine all ingredients in a bowl and enjoy it!
