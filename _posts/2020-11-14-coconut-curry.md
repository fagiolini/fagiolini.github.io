this dish is flavorful and comforting. even for those who don't love the sweetness of the coconut, in this dish it will be balanced by the curry and the only thing that will be left to love, will be the delicious creaminess!

you can change the veggies as you wish and even leave out the tofu (why would you tho!). we suggest you enjoy this dish with some rice! [find the recipe below](#pilaf-rice).

## procedure
---

1. warm up some oil (around 3 tablespoons at least) in a pan and when it's hot put the curry to fry together with paprika, chili flakes and turmeric. this step will allow the flavor to fully come out thanks to the oil. keep stirring not to let it burn!

2. now it's time for the tofu: crumble it or cut it in cubes and add it to the pan to let it absorb all the magnificent flavor.
   
3. add the chopped garlic and onion to the pan and keep stirring.

4. now chop the veggies in small pieces and add them to the pan, together with some salt and the coconut milk

5. add some more curry if you wish and mix it all together. then cover with the lid and let it simmer at medium heat for about 15 minutes, when the milk will have become golden and the veggies soft. garnish with lime slices and some coriander, serve it with some rice and enjoy!

> note: the longer it rests after being cooked, the stronger the flavors get.
