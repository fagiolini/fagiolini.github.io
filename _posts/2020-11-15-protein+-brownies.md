suprising as it seems, these brownies are made with beans, but do not worry: you won't feel even the slightest taste of beans and gain an amazing texture for a dessert packed with proteins!

## ingredients
---

- beans (any kind, this time we used cannellini while beans): 250g
- rolled oats or oat flour: 40g (if you are making it gluten free, make sure your oats are gf)
- sugar (or other sweetner): 60g
- cocoa powder: 10g
- sunflower oil: 40g
- baking powder: 2 teaspoons
- vanilla extract: 2 teaspoons
- dark chocolate: 100g

## procedure
---

1. in a food processor (or a good blender) mix all the ingredients except for the chocolate (beans, oats, sugar, cocoa, oil, baking powder and vanilla extract). mix very well: you should end up with a smooth and thick brown batter.
2. cut the dark chocolate in small pieces
3. add them to the batter and mix with a spoon.
4. pour the batter int a mould, we used a round mould (diameter 22cm), but you can use a square mould 20x20cm (or smaller if you like thicker brownies). spread it well in your mould with the help of a spoon.
5. bake it for 18 minutes at 180Â° C in static oven.
6. let it cool down for at least 10 minutes, then cut it in squares and serve.
