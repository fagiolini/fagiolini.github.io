we all learnt to love a new God during this pandemic, and its name is…banana bread! 

## ingredients:

- preferabily ripe bananas: 3
- all-purpose flour: 260g &rarr
- dates: 10 
- water: 200ml
- baking powder: 16g
- apple cider vinegar: 2 teaspoons
- nuts of choice/chocolate/a mix of the two: 150g
- cinnamon: a teaspoon (optional)
- a pinch of salt

## procedure:
1. start by peeling three ripe bananas and putting them in the blender. 
2. stone 8 large dates, and add them to the rest, along with two teaspoons of apple vinegar, 200 ml of water. at this point blend until you get a dense mixture. 
3. separately, in a large bowl, pour the flour, the baking powder, a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of salt. stir quickly to distribute them well and pour the banana mixture you have just blended, a little at a time, stirring until everything is smooth (and sexy). 
4. finally, you can add the nuts, or you can opt for the dried fruit you prefer - even chocolate is great… just so you know. 
5. alright, you are ready to bake! pour the mixture into a mould, ours was 12x28, and if you want it to look fancy you can decorate it with a few oat flakes and a few more chopped walnuts. 
6. bake for 40 minutes, at 170 degrees, in a static oven...and you’re ready to stuff your stomach with this beauty!
