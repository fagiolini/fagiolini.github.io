 this salad is a real meal-saver: ready in 10 minutes, full of taste and proteins, perfect for a quick lunch during working days!

 *quantities for 2 portions*

## ingredients
---

- salad of choice (we used gentilina lettuce)
- tempeh or [tofu](https://fagiolini.github.io/guide-tofu/): 100g
- soy sauce: 3 tablespoons
- nutritional yeast (optional): 2 tablespoons
- balsamic vinegar (optional)
- salt
- extra-virgin olive oil

## procedure
---

1. cut and wash your lettuce.
2. cut the tempeh in small pieces. if you use plain tofu, cut it in thin slices.
3. warm some extra-virgin olive oil in a pan, add the tempeh or [tofu](https://fagiolini.github.io/guide-tofu/) and cook until golden.
4. add the soysauce to the pan and cook for another minute, until the soy sauce dries and the tempeh/tofu becomes dark.
5. compose your dish: put the salad, then the nutritional yeast, the salt, the balsamic vinegar, the extra-virgin olive oil and, finally, the tempeh or tofu. 
6. serve with a couple of toasted bread slices.

> note: to make it even faster, you can use savory packaged tofu, like smoked tofu, that you don't even need to cook. [learn everything about tofu here.](https://fagiolini.github.io/guide-tofu/)

> note: **tempeh** is an ingredient of indonesian origin. it is made of fermented soy beans, it's full of proteins, it has a stronger taste than tofu and a firmer texture.

> note: **nutritional yeast** is deactivated yeast, which means it doesn't have any raising power. it is salty, crunchy at has a vaguely cheesy taste. it's full of B vitamins and it is perfect as a dressing.
