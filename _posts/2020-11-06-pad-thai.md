pad thai is the most known thai dish and is packed with flavor, besides being fresh and nutritious. The good thing about it, is that itâ€™s a complete and nourishing meal, but also very flexible! All the veggies can be replaced with what you have in your fridge, and the noodles can be rice noodles but also soy or classic wheat noodles! Your choiceðŸ˜Š.
