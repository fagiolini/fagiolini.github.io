## ingredients
---
- flour: 120g
- soy milk: 130g
- water (best if sparkling): 50g
- baking powder: 1 teaspoon
- fresh blueberries (any other berry works just fine): 80g
- blueberries jam: 1 teaspoon (if you don't have this just add some more blueberries)

## procedure
---

1. in a bowl, combine the flour with the baking powder, then add the blueberries, then mix with a whisk 

2. in the same bowl, drizzle in the milk and sparkling water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming

3. then add the blueberry jam and stir again gently to blend the jam with the rest of the batter (optional) 

4. cover the batter to let it rest 20 minutes in the refrigerator 

5. after the 20 minutes, take the batter out of the refrigerator and cook it, one scoop at a time, in a nonstick pan, previously oiled (if necessary, depending on the nonstick quality of the skillet you chose) with a little seed oil. Turn the pancake halfway through cooking, after about 4 minutes.
   
6. guarnish your pancakes with maple syrup and fruits of choice!
