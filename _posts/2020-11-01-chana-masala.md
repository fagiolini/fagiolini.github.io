## procedure:

1. mince the garlic clove and sauté it in a pot with some extravirgin olive oil and the chili pepper.
   
2. add the tomato sauce or purée, with the salt and the sugar (that will help make the tomato less acidic) and half a glass of water.
   
3. add the chana masala and mix well.
   
4. cook at medium heat for 25 minutes.
5. if you are accompanying your chana masala with some rice, it's time to start the cooking of it!  [find the recipe below](#pilaf-rice) 

   
6. add the cooked chickpeas to the tomato sauce: you can either use canned and rinsed chickpeas, or cook your own chickpeas: [here are our suggestions](2020-11-01-pulses-guide.md).

7. mince the ginger and add it: it's important to add it at the end and not at beginning, for it will be more tasty this way.

8. squeeze half a lemon in the pot and mix well.
9. turn off the heat and serve hot.
