## ingredients
---

- almonds: 130g
- flour: 200g 
- sunflower or peanut oil: 120g
- cane sugar: 50g

## procedure
---

1. chop the almonds and toast them for a few minutes in the oven or in the pan.
   
2. mix the oil with the sugar, add the wine.
   
3. add the flour little by little while stirring.
   
4. finally add the almonds and mix until you get a homogeneous paste - there are a lot of almonds so it won't be too compact. 
   
5. spread it out and, with small moulds, separate the cookies.
   
6. bake at 160Â° C for 20 minutes in the oven. while they are hot the cookies will be soft, but they will harden as soon as they cool down.
