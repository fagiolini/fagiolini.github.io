this recipe has a very special flavor: we fell in love the first time we tried it!

*quantities for 2 abundant portions*


## ingredients
---
- onion: 1
- garlic: 1 clove
- cumin: 1 tablespoon  
- celery: 1 stem
- carrot: 1
- vegetable broth  
- juice of 1 lemon
- lentils (best if red): 400g boiled, 180 raw dried

> the carrot and celery are optional as long as you use some other vegetable. this recipe is great to use up those parts of veggies you would throw away: we sometimes make it with the external part of a fennel or the hard part of the broccoli.

## procedure
---

1. in a pot, saut√© the onion and garlic with a drizzle of oil and add the cumin (putting it in the pot now will help it spread the flavor better)
   
2. once the onion looks golden add in the veggies and let them soften a little bit
    
3. then add the lentils and combine all together

4. now it's time for the vegetable broth: pour it into the pot, add half of the lemon juice and cover it with the lid.

5. after 30 minutes your soup should be ready! add in the lemon juice and let it sit for a few moments.

6. we like to blend up half of the soup to make the texture a little more interesting. serve with bread or crostini and a drizzle of raw olive oil!
