## ingredients

- dark chocolate: 70g
- silken [tofu](https://fagiolini.github.io/guide-tofu/): 170g
- sugar/any other sweetener to taste
- nuts or fresh fruit to garnish



## procedure
---

1. melt the chocolate in a bain-marie or microwave and let it cool down.
2. with a blender, blend the velvety tofu until it becomes a smooth cream.
3. gradually add the melted chocolate, and the sugar, if needed (it really depends on how sweet your chocolate is and how you like it, we don't even add any!) continuing to blend. You should get a mousse-like consistency.
4. transfer your mousse into cups and let it rest in the fridge for 15 to 30 minutes. 
5. garnish your mousse with nuts or fresh fuit and enjoy!
