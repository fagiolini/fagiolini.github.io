*quantities for around 8 balls*

## ingredients
---
- dates: 20 

  > there are many different varieties of dates, we mostly use deglet noir dates which are the easiest to find and they're the cheapest too. feel free to use any type of date but just keep in mind that the softer they are, the better.
- nuts of choice: 50g


## procedure
---

1. all you gotta do is pit the dates and throw them in a mixer with your nuts of choice (we like to use walnuts and almonds)

2. blend until you have a sticky dough like mixture

3. then, use your hands to scoop out about 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture into your hands and roll them into a small energy bites.
 
4. here they are! you can choose to customize your balls as you wish: you can roll them in some cocoa powder, in some cinnamon or even in some coconut flakes. of course we chose melted dark chocolate for ours!

5. store your balls in the fridge in an air tight container and you're good to go (we know they're not gonna last more than a day though:) !
