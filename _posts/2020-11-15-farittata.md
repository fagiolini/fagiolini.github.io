*farittata* is our vegan version of the italian "*frittata*", the omelette. we mixed the recipe for "*frittata*" with that for "*farinata*", another typical italian recipe made out of chickpeas flour. the result is a tasty vegan omelette with a good protein content!

for the filling use the veggies you prefer, or just the ones you have in your fridge! we tried with onions, spinach, leeks and zucchini and loved each one of them.

*quantities for 4 portions*

## ingredients
---

- chickpeas flour: 150g
- water: 250g
- onions: 3
- salt and pepper
- extra-virgin olive oil

## procedure
---

1. mix the chickpeas flour with the water, add some salt and black pepper. let it rest while you cook your veggies.
   
2. chop your vegetables of choice, onions in our case, in thin slices and saut√© in a pan.
   
3. when they have softened, add them to the chickpeas batter and mix well.
   
4. warm some extra-virgin oilve oil in a nonstick pan (if your pan sticks, even just a bit, be generous with olive oil).
   
5. pour the batter in the pan and cook at low heat for 5 to 10 minutes. the surface will dry a bit and the bottom will become golden and well firm.
   
6. it's time to flip the farittata: cover with a flat lid and flip. then let it slide back in the pan (add olive oil if needed).
   
7. cook for a few more minutes, then turn off and serve.

> suggestion: to give your *farittata* an ethnic flavor, try adding some curry and/or some tumeric.
