## ingredients
---
- dry cookies: 180g 
- dark chocolate: 200g
- vegetable milk (we used soy): 70ml 
- seed oil: 50ml
- chopped hazelnuts: 60g (or other dried fruit of your choice, or 60g extra cookies)

## procedure
---

1. start with 180 grams of your favorite cookies. pour them onto a dry cloth, seal them on all sides and crush them by pressing down with your hands. once broken up well, keep them aside.


2. then pour the dark chocolate in a bain-marie, to melt it without burning the bottom. we chose 70% dark chocolate, we recommend not to go over because otherwise it will be too bitter! 

3. once all the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat and add the vegetable milk and the seed oil. stir well both to make the mixture fluid and to allow it to cool before adding the cookies. 
 
4. now add 60 grams of chopped hazelnuts or your favorite dried fruit... if you don't like the idea, just add 60 grams more cookies!

5. at this point you can add the cookies!

6. mix quickly, pour everything on a sheet of baking paper, and roll it well trying to give it the typical shape. roll it up and close the ends like a candy, and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. then it's ready to enjoy!
