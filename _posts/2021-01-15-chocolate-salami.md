## ingredients
---
- dry cookies: 180g 
- dark chocolate: 200g
- plant-based milk (we used soy): 70g
- seed oil: 45g
- chopped hazelnuts or other nuts: 60g (or 60g extra cookies)

## procedure
---

1. pour the dark chocolate in a bain-marie, to melt it without burning the bottom. we chose 70% dark chocolate, if you are using a darker chocolate, add a couple of spoons of sugar or your salami will be too bitter!

2. while the chocolate melts, pour 180g of your favorite cookies onto a dry cloth, seal them on all sides and crush them by pressing down with your hands. once broken up well, keep them aside.

3. once all the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat and add the vegetable milk and the seed oil. stir well both to reach a smooth mixture.
   
4. now add the crushed cookies and 60 grams of chopped hazelnuts or your favorite nut... if you don't like the idea, just add 60 more grams of cookies!

5. mix quickly with a spoon, pour everything on a sheet of baking paper and roll it well trying to give it the typical shape. roll it up and close the ends like a candy. 

6.  let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. then it's ready to enjoy!
