as all pulses, beans are a great source of plant-based proteins. to fully benefit from them couple the beans with corn tortillas or with some rice! [find the recipe below](#pilaf-rice). 

*quantities for 2 abundant portions*

## ingredients
---

- beans (red, black, or kidney): 400g boiled, 180 raw dried
- onion: 1/2
- bell pepper (any colour): 1
- tomato sauce or purée: 250g
- tomato concentrate (optional): 1 tablespoon
- chili pepper to taste
- salt
- sugar: 1 teaspoon

## procedure
---
0. if they are not canned, boil your beans: [find our suggestions for cooking pulses here](https://fagiolini.github.io/pulses-guide/).

1. chop the onion in thin slices and sauté with extra-virgin olive oil and chili peppers (quantity depending on your taste).
   
2. chop the bell peppers and add to the onion with some salt. cook for some 10 minutes.
   
3. add the tomato sauce or purée with a glass of water and cook on low heat for 25 minutes. a teaspoon of sugar will help make the sauce less acidic.
   
4. if you are accompanying your chili beans with some rice, it's time to start the cooking of it!  [find the recipe below](#pilaf-rice). 
   
5. back to the sauce: after 25 minutes of cooking, taste it: if it’s well cooked and not acidic add the cooked beans, otherwise wait a bit more.
   
6. add a tablespoon of tomato concentrate.
   
7. cook on medium heat for a few more minutes.
   
8. serve with tortillas or rice, or even tortillas filled with chili beans *and* rice!
