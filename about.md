this website aims at helping people to integrate more *easy-peasy* plant-based recipes in their every-day life. 

we like to optimize our recipes with respect to the following criteria:
- **time**: every-day life meals must be quick to prepare. our recipes are fast because they require few, simple steps and few ingredients. furthermore, they are all suitable for meal-prepping: you can cook large quantities, store, and have your meals ready for the following days.
- **taste**: treating yourself is important, and we want you to do it with the least effort.
- **nutritional value**: we privilege dishes that are well balanced in carbs, proteins and fats, so that one simple recipe can make your whole meal.
- **simple ingredients**: the ones you can easily find in most supermarkets and that you probably already have at home. if you are missing something do not worry, we also propose alternatives to make our recipes flexible. few ingredients might seem unusual to those who are new to plant-based cooking, but we make sure you that you can easily get to know them and employ them in many of the recipes we propose.
